# PICKUP Flutter App
An app to display nearby courts for ios and android (only set up location permissions for ios at the moment)

## Does this include a real API call?
Yes, I'm using Google Places API to fetch data from the user's current location.

## How does it work?
Using the flutter_bloc library, state management becomes easy to handle. It takes an event and maps it into a state.
